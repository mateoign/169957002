I made this visualization with DS3.js to visualize Shohei Ohtani's perplexing 2022 season. He is the first true two way player since Babe Ruth and is the best player in baseball today. When I finished this project in March of 2023, I was watching the Japan vs USA Baseball World Cup where Shohei struck out Mike Trout. To me, seeeing Shohei put away the best player in of the last 10 years was the truth, he stands alone at the top.
